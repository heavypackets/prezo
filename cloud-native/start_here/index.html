# Cloud Native: Start Here
## An exploration into the cloud-native ecosystem

# Agenda
* What is Cloud Native?
* What is the CNCF?
* Landscape Overview
* What about Kubernetes?
* Get Involved
* Let's Hangout

???

This is a loose agenda. Please comment if you have any questions during the talk, I'll address them

# What is cloud native?
[CNCF Cloud Native Definition v1.0 ](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/DEFINITION.md)

???

Turns out, there is a formal definition on GitHub

---

# The Goal
“Cloud native technologies
empower organizations to build
and run scalable applications in
modern, dynamic environments
such as public, private, and hybrid clouds.” - CNCF

---

# The Method
"Techniques that enable loosely
coupled systems that are
resilient, manageable, and
observable. Combined with
robust automation, they allow
teams to make high-impact
changes frequently and
predictably without pain" - CNCF

---

# In practice, this means...

---

# DevOps
--

_It's mostly that simple_

---

# But, more specifically...

---

### Containers & Microservices
### Service Mesh
### CI/CD
### Infrastructure as Code
### Zero-Trust
### Distributed Observability

---

# Why is this stuff important?

--

Deploying applications _effectively and efficiently_ to the cloud requires fundamental changes to how we write applications and think about operations

---

# Why is this stuff important?

While you can "lift and shift" your monoliths to a VPC, it will waste a lot of money and prevent the operational agility demanded by businesses today

???

The compute density of most data centers is extremely low. The app on a VM paradigm works, but

# What is the CNCF?
## Cloud Native Computing Foundation

---

# Cloud Native Computing Foundation
The CNCF is a sub-org of the not-for-profit [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org). It exists to foster the cloud native technology ecosystem,
providing guidelines for project maturity & community, as well as financial & legal support.

[Charter](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/charter.md)

---

# Important Points

---

## Membership

The CNCF is comprised of [members](https://www.cncf.io/about/members/), like the Linux Foundation.

--

Many of these organizations are technology contributors, but most are end-user organizations that use cloud native technologies and want to get involved in the community.

---

## Projects

Many projects are _donated_ to the CNCF by members and are voted in by commitee.

--

This includes a vetting process, to insure that the project is indeed OSS, has a diverse set of contributors, and is governed in a truly pragmatic way.

---

# Project Graduation

---

## Sandbox to Graduation

New CNCF projects are expected to go through 3 phases: Sandbox, Incubating and Graduated

---

# Sandbox to Graduation
This maturity model is detailed in the book: Crossing the Chasm.

It gives enterprise and end-users a key metric in determining when a project is ready for adoption at scale.

???

This doesn't mean you can't use projects that aren't yet graducated, but you may experient some rough edges

---

## Notable Projects that have Graduated:
Envoy (Service Mesh)

Fluentd (Logging)

Prometheus (Metrics)

---

# What about Kubernetes?

---

## TL;DR: It's a highly flexible container orchestrator

--

That's it
