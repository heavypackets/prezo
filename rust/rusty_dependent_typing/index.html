## Rust is not a "dependently typed" language
This isn't critical for us, but Rust makes a poor theorem prover.

---
class: center, middle

## Rust is not a "dependently typed" language
This means that most value proofs must be evaluated at runtime. The compiler isn't capable of checking many axioms statically

???

But, even in dependently typed languages, certain value proofs can only evaluated at runtime and this is idiomatic

---
class: center, middle

## Definitions are hard
Most formal definitions in type theory land demand serious prerequisite knowlege of existing type concepts and nomenclature

---
class: center, middle

## Definitions are hard
This talk attempts to stick to nomenclature familiar to Rust developers while keeping true to formal definitions.

Any deviations will called out.

???

If you approach Rust from languages like C/C++, it's likely most of this material will be new

---
class: center, middle

## There are many dependent type theories
The talk takes most of its definitions from Martin-L√∂f dependent type theory

???

If you know what these means, much of this talk will not be new to you

---
class: center, middle

## Code is Math
Code is the common way developers communicate. Let's use it as much as possible to show our concepts.
---
class: center, middle

## Ask Questions!
_Please_, please interrupt if there are things you do not grok. You are _never_ the only one who doesn't

---
class: center, middle

#So, let's get started

---
class: center, middle

# Why are we here?

???

So let's ask: Why are we here? You probably fall into one of three camps.

---
class: center, middle

# What's a Rust?
_Come back next month!_

_(mostly joking)_

???
If this last camp is you, there's good concepts here but the latter half of the talk will be very Rusty. Feel free to ask questions, but I _may_ do some hand waving over things to get through it

---
class: center, middle

# Types systems are cool!
_Correct_

---
class: center, middle

# Security is cool!
_Also, correct_

---
class: center, middle
![What if I told you, a strong type system is security](security.jpg)

Let's go into some examples to demonstrate this!

---
class: center, middle
Let's pretend we have a Ruby on Rails app. This app is some fictional "bidding" ecommerce platform.

---
There's a simple HTML form on an page that takes a textbox bid amount for some item who's ID is stored in a hidden field.

Within the controller we have:

```ruby
item = @params['form']['item']
amount = @params['form']['amount'].to_f()

bid = Bid::new(item, amount)
Bidder::submit_bid bid
if bid.highest?() do
        println!("Highest bid!")
end
```
Even if you don't know Ruby, try to spot possible vulnaribilties (there are many).

---

```ruby
item = @params['form']['item']
amount = @params['form']['amount'].to_f()

bid = Bid::new(item, amount)
Bidder::submit_bid bid
if bid.highest?() do
        println!("Highest bid!")
end
```
What happens if the form amount is negative? (Easy)
--


- submit_bid gets a negative float -- does is know how to handle this?
--


What happens if the form field amount contains a word? (Harder)
--


- String::to_f() will try its best to coerce it to a valid float. If that doesn't work, it returns 0.0
--


What happens if the bid amount is $2000000000.00? (Hardest)
--


- Sorry user, but that type checks!

---
class: center, middle
# Let's try this in Rust -- that should help, right?

---
```rust
#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct Bid {
   item: u32,
   amount: f64,
}

fn bid_handler(bid: Form<Bid>) -> Result<String> {
    if let Ok(BidStatus::Highest) = Bidder::submit_bid(&bid) {
        Ok("Highest bid!")
    } else {
        Ok("")
    }
}
```
Huzzah! Types! This looks better! But is it?

???
Note: This uses the Rocket web frameworks

---
```rust
#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct Bid {
   item: u32,
   amount: f64,
}

fn bid_handler(bid: Form<Bid>) -> Result<String> {
    if let Ok(BidStatus::Highest) = Bidder::submit_bid(&bid) {
        Ok("Highest bid!")
    } else {
        Ok("")
    }
}
```
What happens if the form amount is negative? (Easy)
--


- submit_bid still gets a negative float -- unsigned floats don't exist in Rust
--


What happens if the form field amount contains a word? (Harder)
--


- Serde will try to coerce it to a float. If unsuccessful, a Bid cannot be created and the handler is never called üëç

---
```rust
#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct Bid {
   item: u32,
   amount: f64,
}

fn bid_handler(bid: Form<Bid>) -> Result<String> {
    if let Ok(BidStatus::Highest) = Bidder::submit_bid(&bid) {
        Ok("Highest bid!")
    } else {
        Ok("")
    }
}
```
What happens if the bid amount is $2000000000.00? (Hardest)
--


- Sorry user, but that still type checks!
---
class: center, middle

# Even with a stronger type system this has only marginally improved!
Valid Bids cannot be enforced through types alone -- these contraints represent a kind of _type invariant_.
---
class: center, middle

# What are type invariants?
--

These are a kind of constraint between members of an object (product type) that must remain correct during it's lifetime.

---
class: center, middle

## No operations can result in an object state such that the invariants are no longer satisfied!
_Caveat: Internal methods can temporarily break the invariant_

---
class: center, middle

### You might be thinking: "But wait! We have immutability! And we avoid OOP hell, so our types are simple!"
--

True! And we'll see how this helps us later.

---
class: center, middle

# Let's look at an example.

---
class: middle

## Let's say our Bid is only valid if it's amount is:
- Over 1 dollar
- Less than 1000000 dollars

---
class: center, middle

### In our case, enforcing our constaints is easy. However, this can get complicated.

---

# Why is this important to application security?
--

- Improper value validation is a large cause of bugs and vulnerabilities.

--

- It's often not clear where the responsibility lies to enforce these constaints.

--

- Keeping validation synchronized is hard and there's often no source of truth.

--

- Fuzzing attempts to catch many of these bugs, but it can be slow and non-deterministic.

---
class: center, middle

# Let's try to improve this!
---

```rust
#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct Bid {
   item: u32,
   amount: f64,
}

fn bid_handler(bid: Form<Bid>) -> Result<String> {
    if bid.amount < 1.0 || bid.amount > 1000000 {
        panic!("Invalid bid");
    }

    if let Ok(BidStatus::Highest) = Bidder::submit_bid(&bid) {
        Ok("Highest bid!")
    } else {
        Ok("")
    }
}
```
Now, we validate the Bid before it gets sent to submit_bid. But there's issues with this:
--

- This logic has to be duplicated everywhere a Bid is created
--

- The value _predicate_ (amount < 1.00 || amount > 1000000) isn't a described part of the type itself. Therefore, an instance of the type carries no _proof_

???

That may be a bit confusing. But we'll discuss _provability_ in just a bit

---
class: center, middle

# Let's iterate again

---
```rust
#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct Bid {
   item: u32,
   amount: f64,
}

impl Bid {
    fn is_valid(&self) -> bool {
        if self.amount >= 1.0 && self.amount < 1000000 { true }
        else { false }
    }
}

fn bid_handler(bid: Form<Bid>) -> Result<String> {
    if bid.is_valid() == false {
            panic!("Invalid bid");
    }

    if let Ok(BidStatus::Highest) = Bidder::submit_bid(&bid) {
        Ok("Highest bid!")
    } else {
        Ok("")
    }
}
```
We naturally move the that predicate into a method.
---
class: middle

## But there are issues with this too:
- We can still create an invalid instance of Bid!
--


- There is nothing forcing us to check if the bid is valid before using it.

---
class: center, middle

## What if we can prevent the creation of a Bid unless it's constraints are satisfied? ü§î
We can! (sorta)

---
class: center, middle

#Smart constructors
Let's iterate, _again_

---
```rust
#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct Bid {
   item: u32,
   amount: f64,
}

impl Bid {
    fn new(item: u32, amount: f64) -> Option<Bid> {
        if amount >= 1.0 && amount < 1000000 {
            Some(Bid {item, amount})
        } else {
            None
        }
    }
}

fn bid_handler(bid: Form<Bid>) -> Result<String> {
    if let Ok(BidStatus::Highest) = Bidder::submit_bid(&bid) {
        Ok("Highest bid!")
    } else {
        Ok("")
    }
}
```
Whew! We've captured our predicate in the constructor!
---
class: center, middle

# Why does this work?

---
class: middle

- Constructors aren't special in Rust but...

--

- We can prevent construction of a type outside of it's module if one or more members are private.


--
- We can use PhantomData to create an unused private field if needed.

---
class: center, middle

# Why doesn't this work? üò°

---
class: middle

- The type only goes through our predicate once. If it any of the fields referenced by the predicate are mutable, then it cannot be used as _proof_

--

- Lots of new wiring has to be written to get Serde to deserialize into a _maybe type_.

---
class: center, middle

# What's a _maybe type_?

Another name for an Option. A value may exist (Some) or may not exist (None).

---
class: center, middle

# What's a _maybe type_?

Here, we can say our a Bid _maybe_ exists based on the parameters used in the constructor because it returns an Option.

--


Our predicate is _decidable_ -- it can only evaluate to true or false. So...


--

If our predicate (amount >= 1.0 && amount < 1000000) is true, then we can say we've _proved_ that a valid Bid exists

---
class: center, middle

# Why does proof matter to security and safety?
---
class: center, middle

## Imagine if we could say "if this instance of the type exists, it's proof to it's validity or correctness?"
or

---
class: center, middle

## Imagine if we could say "if this instance of the type exists, it's proposition has been proven"
### This is considered a form of _existential quantification_ and is useful for building proofs about our programs using our types

???
This last bit is an important trait of the "propositions as types" of Martin-L√∂f dependent type theory. This will be important later

---
class: middle

## This would: 
- Dramatically simplify our code paths by bringing responsibilities of validation to the type itself

- Bring us closer to formal validation of our software

- Allow us to safely perform complex transformations on types*

* Only if our types are immutable! 

---
class: middle

## This we can implement more securely this way: 
- Access control and permissions

- Parsing routines

- Protocols

- Everything

---
class: center, middle

# And that, folks, are dependent types!
_cue curtains_

---
class: center, middle

## Well almost. Let's go into some detail
But before we do, any questions?

---
class: center, middle

# Dependent Types

---
class: middle

## Definition: "a dependent type is a type whose definition depends on a value."

???

So lets define what a dependent type is. Makes sense?

---
class: center, middle

## Makes sense? üò¨

---

## Let's give some examples:
--

- The type Car is dependent on the amount of horsepower the Car has

--

- The type Car is dependent on whether is has a gasoline engine, electric or both

--

- The type Car is dependent on how many doors is has

--

- The _existance_ of Car is dependent on the existance of 4 wheels

--


### Some of these values are scalar, but some of them represent different variants. A type can be dependent on any other kind of type
--

Types like "Supercar" or "compact car" or "Hybrid" are all _dependently typed variations_ represented by different values of members of the type Car.

Moreover, a Car cannot exist without > 0 engines and exactly 4 wheels
---
class: center, middle

# Isn't this what traits are trying to solve? ü§î 
--

Well, how would represent this with traits?
---
```rust
trait CarT {
    fn engines(&self) -> &Vec<Engine>;
    fn wheels(&self) -> &HashMap<Position, Wheel>;
    fn hp(&self) -> u32;
}
struct Car {
    engines: Vec<Engine>,
    wheels: HashMap<Position, Wheel>,
    HP: u32, 
}
impl CarT for Car { .. }

trait Compact : CarT {}
trait Hybrid : CarT {}
trait Supercar : CarT {}
```
--
Immediately there's problems:
--

- We cannot constrain the car traits to only type Car (yet). So we must create a trait CarT that is implemented by Car

--

- But there's nothing keeping us from implementing CarT for a Motorcycle type! It also has motors, engines, and wheels!

---
```rust
trait CarT {
    fn engines(&self) -> &Vec<Engine>;
    fn wheels(&self) -> &HashMap<Position, Wheel>;
    fn hp(&self) -> u32;
}
struct Car {
    engines: Vec<Engine>,
    wheels: HashMap<Position, Wheel>,
    HP: u32, 
}
impl CarT for Car { .. }

trait Compact : CarT {}
trait Hybrid : CarT {}
trait Supercar : CarT {}
```
--

- There's nothing keeping a type from implementing Compact *and* Supercar -- does this make sense? If it doesn't, our type system can't help us

--

- There's nothing enforcing our 4 wheel predicate for the existence of a Car

--


Obviously, we cannot use these types as proof of anything
---
class: center, middle

# Let's iterate
---
```rust
struct Car {
    engines: Vec<Engine>,
    wheels: HashMap<Position, Wheel>,
    HP: u32, 
}

impl Car {
    fn new(engines: Vec<Engine>, wheels: HashMap<Position, Wheel>, HP: u32) -> Option<Car> {
        if wheels != 4 { None }
        else { Some(Car { engines, wheels, HP}) }
    }
}

struct Hybrid(Car);

impl Hybrid {
    fn new(car: Car) -> Option<Hybrid> {
        if /** car.engines contains both an electric and gasoline  */ {
            Some(Hybrid(Car))
        } else { None }
    }
}
```
We're getting there!

???
Notice: What heppens if Car does not meet our predicate? It's simply consumed. There's no way to return it back to the calling funcion. We *could* store a reference instead, but this has a different meaning
---
class: middle

### We can now:
-  Prove that all instances of Cars have 4 wheels

--

- Lift an a proven instance of Car _into_ a Hybrid if we have proof it has both electric and gas engine

--

- Provide proof that an instance of Hybrid is both a Hybrid and Car

By making our types composible, we can also compose propositions!

--

---
class: center, middle

##  This is most of the way there. Can we make this more ergonomic?
--

Maybe. But we need unstable Rust.

---
```rust
struct Car {
    engines: Vec<Engine>,
    wheels: HashMap<Position, Wheel>,
    HP: u32, 
}

impl Car {
    fn new(engines: Vec<Engine>, wheels: HashMap<Position, Wheel>, HP: u32) -> Option<Car> {
        if wheels != 4 { None }
        else { Some(Car { engines, wheels, HP}) }
    }
}

struct Hybrid(Car);

impl std::conversion::TryFrom<Car> for Hybrid {
    type Error = Car;

    fn try_from(car: Car) -> Result<Hybrid, Self::Error> {
        if /** car.engines contains both an electric and gasoline  */ {
            Ok(Hybrid(Car))
        } else { Err(Car) }
    }
}
```
???
Notice, try_from returns a Result type. If it doesn't satisfy the predicate, it can be returned to the caller.
---
This allows us to do things like:

```rust
let car = get_car_from_lot();

match Hybrid::try_from(car) {
    Ok(hybrid)  => ...
    Err(car) => ...
}
```

---
class: middle

## We've looked at two use cases of dependent typing:
--

- Existentially predicated types (or propositional types)
    - This type only exists if...

--

- Predicated type variants
    - This kind of type only exists if...

--

But! These are only some basic use-cases
